## Project Introduction
Over the past few years, with a rapidly rising housing market, it has seemed impossible for a college student or almost anyone to afford a new house in the Seattle area. This, however, is not just a problem thatâ€™s seen here. We can also see this occurring in various states within the United States. For our final project, we decided to examine the change over the last 10 years of the ratio between income and housing costs throughout the world. Our goal is to create a useful tool for helping first time homeowners with deciding on a suitable economy to buy their first house in.

## Functions
The map has circle on a few random countries across the world that you can hover on to see the percent change from 2012 to 2022. There is a legend in the bottom left corner for the colors of the dots. We have also added a table on the right to show the data of the countries. On the table there is a sort function that allows the user to sort the table by % change.
