## Project Introduction
Over the past few years, with a rapidly rising housing market, it has seemed impossible for a college student or almost anyone to afford a new house in the Seattle area. This, however, is not just a problem thatâ€™s seen here. We can also see this occurring in various states within the United States. For our final project, we decided to examine the change over the last 10 years of the ratio between income and housing costs throughout the world, specifically focusing on countries that are part of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Our goal is to create a useful tool for helping first time homeowners with deciding on a suitable economy to buy their first house in.

## Functions
The map has points located on each of the OECD countries across the world that you can hover over to see the each country's percent change in housing price to income ratio from 2012 to 2022. There is a legend in the bottom left corner detailing the categorization of these points. Additionally, we added a table on the right with more extensive data for each of the countries. Included with the table is a sort function that allows the user to sort the countries in the table by % change, both ascending and descending.

## Conclusion
After mapping out the price to income ratio for 2012 and 2022, we found it interesting how the highest difference was in Luxembourg (LUX), with 70.42%. We also found it interesting that Romania (ROU) had a -41.62% change between 2012 and 2022. This meant that instead of the ratio increasing, this country was able to close the gap between housing prices and income rates.
